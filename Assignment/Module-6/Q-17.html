    <h1>What is the result of the expression true && false || false && true?</h1>

    <p>
        The logical OR (||) (logical disjunction) operator for a set of operands
        is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true. It is
        typically used with boolean (logical) values. When it is, it returns a
        Boolean value. However, the || operator actually returns the value of
        one of the specified operands, so if this operator is used with
        non-Boolean values, it will return a non-Boolean value.

        first condition is false & second is also false so logical OR operator
        return result is <mark>false</mark>
