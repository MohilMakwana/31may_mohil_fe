    <h2>
        the main looping structures in JavaScript are:
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>for loop: Executes a block of code a specified number of times.</li>
        <li>while loop: Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.</li>
        <li>do-while loop: Similar to a while loop, but ensures the code block is executed at least once before the condition is checked.</li>
        <li>for...in loop: Iterates over the enumerable properties of an object.</li>
        <li>for...of loop: Iterates over iterable objects like arrays, strings, and other iterable objects.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>These looping structures provide flexibility for executing code repetitively based on different conditions and data structures in JavaScript.</p>
    <h2>we are taken the example of for loop and find its working in script and consol</h2>
    <script>
        for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
    </script>
