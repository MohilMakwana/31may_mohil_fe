    <h1>What is the drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects? </h1>
<p>Encapsulation and Modularity: Lack of encapsulation and difficulty in accessing private variables or methods.

    Readability: Object literals can become cluttered and less readable, especially with longer or complex methods.
    
    Testing and Reusability: Methods are less reusable and harder to test independently.
    
    Prototypal Inheritance: Directly declared methods do not benefit from prototypal inheritance, potentially leading to higher memory usage.
    
    Code Maintenance: Refactoring and extending functionality can be more challenging and error-prone.</p>
