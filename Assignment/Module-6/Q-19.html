    <h1>What is the use of is Nan function? </h1>
    <p>
        The NaN function, often seen in programming or mathematical contexts, stands for "Not a Number." It typically refers to a value or state that is not representable as a numerical value or is undefined within a particular context. In many programming languages, including JavaScript and Python, NaN is used to indicate the result of an operation that doesn't yield a meaningful numeric value, such as dividing zero by zero or attempting to perform arithmetic with non-numeric data.
