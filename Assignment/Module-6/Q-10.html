    <h1>What is Condition Statement?</h1>
    <p>
        allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on conditions. If the condition meets then a particular block of action will be executed otherwise it will execute another block of action that satisfies that particular condition.</p>

<p>There are several methods that can be used to perform Conditional Statements in JavaScript.</p>

<ul>
    <li>if statement: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.</li>
    <li>else statement: Executes a block of code if the same condition of the preceding if statement is false.</li>
    <li>else if statement: Adds more conditions to the if statement, allowing for multiple alternative conditions to be tested.</li>
    <li>switch statement: Evaluates an expression, then executes the case statement that matches the expressionâ€™s value.</li>
    <li>ternary operator (conditional operator): Provides a concise way to write if-else statements in a single line.</li>
    
</ul>
