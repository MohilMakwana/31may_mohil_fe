    <h1>What is the difference between && and || in JavaScript?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            && (logical AND) returns true if both operands are true. It evaluates from left to right and stops and returns false immediately if any operand is false.

        </li>
        <li>
            || (logical OR) returns true if at least one operand is true. It evaluates from left to right and stops and returns true immediately if any operand is true.

        </li>
        <li>
            && returns true if all conditions are true.

        </li>
        <li>
            || returns true if at least one condition is true.
