    <h1>What is redux?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Redux is a JavaScript library that helps manage an application's state, or the data and variables that
            determine how it behaves and what it shows to the user.</li>
        <li>Redux centralizes an application's state and logic, which makes it easier to implement features like
            undo/redo and state persistence.</li>
        <li>Redux provides a predictable way to manage state, which makes it easier to understand how the application's
            state changes, debug issues, and test.</li>
    </ul>
