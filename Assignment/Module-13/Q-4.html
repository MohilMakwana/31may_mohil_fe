    <h1>What is the second argument that can optionally be passed tosetState and what is its purpose? </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The second argument that can optionally be passed to setState is a callback function which gets called immediately after the setState is completed and the components get re-rendered.</li>
        <br>
        <li>If you want your program to update the value of a state using setState and then perform certain actions on the updated value of the state then you must specify those actions in a function which should be the second argument of the setState. If we do not do so then those actions will be performed on the previous value of state because of the asynchronous nature of setState.</li>
    </ul>
