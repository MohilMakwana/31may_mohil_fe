    <h1>What is redux Thunk used for?</h1>
    <p><b>Ans:-</b> Redux Thunk is a middleware that allows you to write functions that interact with a Redux store's dispatch and getState methods. It's used for handling asynchronous logic inside action creators in a Redux application. It lets you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Write async logic ahead of time: You can write async logic without knowing what Redux store is being used.</li>
        <li>Delay action dispatch: You can delay when an action is dispatched.</li>
        <li>Dispatch actions based on conditions: You can dispatch actions only if certain conditions are met.</li>
        <li>Handle complex logic: You can write more complex logic that involves asynchronous operations.</li>
    </ul>
