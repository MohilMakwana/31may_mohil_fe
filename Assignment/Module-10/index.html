    <h3>Question:1). Explain Life cycle in Class Component and functional component with Hooks.</h3>
    <pre>
          A React Component undergoes three phases in its lifecycle 
            1). Initialization
            2). Mouting
            3). Update 
            4). Unmouting
        
        <h4>1). Initialization: </h4> 
            <pre>
                <i>Initialization</i>

                when a new object is created from the class. Initializing the state within the constructor function
                allows the state object to be created before React renders the component.
            </pre>

        <h4>2). Mouting: Mouting is a phase when a new component is created and inserted in DOM.</h4>
            <pre>
                <i>componentDidMount</i>

                The componentDidMount lifecycle method executes once after initial rendering. If an empty dependency array is provided as the second argument,
                the callback function executes only after initial rendering.
            </pre>

        <h4>3). Updating: It's a phase when component update or re-renders.<br> Thsi phase occur multiple time that can be benefits of react js.</h4>
            <pre>
                <i>componentDidUpdate</i>

                componentDidUpdate is a lifecycle method in React that is called after a component has been updated and re-rendered. By default,
                it executes after every render, including the initial rendering. 
                If a dependency array is provided, it will execute during the initial rendering and whenever any of
                the specified values in the array change.
            </pre>

        <h4>4). Unmouting: Unmouting is the process when data can be remove from DOM.</h4>

            <pre>
                <i>componentWillUnmount</i>

                The componentWillUnmount lifecycle method executes when the component is unmounted. If a function is returned from the call function,
                that function executes when the component is unmounted.
