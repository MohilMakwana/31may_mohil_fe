    <b>Q-11 What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?</b>
    <p><b>Ans:-</b> <br>
        <b>Inline element</b> <br>
        - In inline element height and width is according to the content. <br>
        - Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. <br>
        <b>Eg.</b> inline element - b, i , u, img, a etc. <br> <br> <br>
        <b>Block level element</b> <br>
    - While in the block level element width is full width of the screen. <br>
    - Block-level elements are those that start on a new line and take up the entire width of their container by default. <br>
    <b>Eg.</b> Block level element - p, br, blockquote, h1 to h6 etc.
